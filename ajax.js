// AJAX : asynchronous javascript and xml
// HTTP request

// with Ajax, web application can send and retrive
// data from a server asynchronously (in the background)
// without interfering with the display and behaviour of
// the exsisting page

// we have 3 most common ways to create and send request to server
// 1.) xmlHTTPRequest (old way of doing)
// 2.) fetch api (new way of doing)
// 3.) axios (this is a third party library)

// we don't use data in xml format anymore.
// we use JSON now.

// HTTP status codes:

// 1.) 1xx informational response – the request was received, continuing process
// 2.) 2xx successful – the request was successfully received, understood, and accepted
// 3.) 3xx redirection – further action needs to be taken in order to complete the request
// 4.) 4xx client error – the request contains bad syntax or cannot be fulfilled
// 5.) 5xx server error – the server failed to fulfil an apparently valid request
