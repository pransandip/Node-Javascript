// JS
// synchronous progamming language, means it's execute one line at a time
// and single threaded, means single thread will execute one line then go to next line

// compilation
// code execution

// why compilation ?

// How javascript code executes ?

// what is global exection context?
// what is local execution context?
// closures

// How javascript works
// 1.) compile
// 2.) code execute

// But in official document of Ecma script compilation not mentioned
// only 1.)Early error checking, 2.)variables apropiate scope
// now to do this work you have to parse the code first*

// compilation phase also in three parts -->
// 1.) Tokenizing/Lexing :- here all the code divide into small pieces
// 2.) Parsing* :- important! than creates AST(Abstruct syntax tree) by understanding those small pieces (Tokens)
// 3.) Code generation (some kind of executable code) :- than we can execute (code execution phase)

// code execution phase
// 1.) in JS code executes inside execution context
// 2.) and very beginning global execution context created

// Global execution context
// 1.)creation phase
// 2.)code execution phase

// when we execute the code, global execution context will added to stack
